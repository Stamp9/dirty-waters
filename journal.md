4. want to check: the final goal is the evaluation of ssc transparency, and the tool we want to develop is here to help
5. do we only focus javascript wallets when evaluating
6. how we deal with the different package manager(yarn,different version, gradle, pnpm) problem, do we need more general method

1. Tasks(repo & trace) [Steps](./steps.md)
todo:
-[] where does patches come from - exact code & authors & why

e.g. @eslint/eslintrc@patch:@eslint/eslintrc@npm%3A2.0.2#./.yarn/patches/@eslint-eslintrc-npm-2.0.2-d308674d86.patch::version=2.0.2&hash=c0def0&locator=metamask-crx%40workspace%3A.

-[] We want to know the change & author(maybe also who merge the commit) of all deps
-[] is there's anything unususal things(new contributor)


The tool we want to have:

question the tool to answer: In a new realease, who are the new contributor automatically

The final tool needs to generate a user-friendly summary


-[x] check: ledger-live @patches
ledger-live use pnpm, use `pnpm patch` & `pnpm patch-commit`, it generated the patch file authomatically
- https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/patches
- https://pnpm.io/cli/patch
